            <p>I am Zulfar Azizi, a passionate and curious learner from Kabul, Afghanistan. Currently, I am pursuing studies in Business Administration at UoPeople University and Computer Science at AUW University. I have always been fascinated by technology, problem-solving, and creative thinking, which drive me to explore coding, digital tools, and innovative ideas. Beyond academics, I enjoy discovering new things, connecting with people, and challenging myself to grow in both personal and professional ways.</p>
            <p>My interests lie at the intersection of business and technology, where I can combine analytical skills with creativity. I aim to build a career that allows me to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, whether in tech, business strategy, or digital solutions. In the future, I hope to become a skilled professional who can inspire others, lead projects that make a difference, and continue learning throughout life to stay at the forefront of emerging trends.</p>
